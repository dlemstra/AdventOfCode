# --- Part Two ---

Now, you're ready to remove the garbage.

To prove you've removed it, you need to count all of the characters within the garbage. The leading and trailing < and > don't count, nor do any canceled characters or the ! doing the canceling.

  - <>, 0 characters.
  - <random characters>, 17 characters.
  - <<<<>, 3 characters.
  - <{!>}>, 2 characters.
  - <!!>, 0 characters.
  - <!!!>>, 0 characters.
  - <{o"i!a,<{i<a>, 10 characters.

How many non-canceled characters are within the garbage in your puzzle input?
